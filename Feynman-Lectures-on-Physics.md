# CHAPTER 1. Atoms in Motion

## 1-1. Introduction

The first three chapters will therefore outline the relation of physics to the rest of the sciences, the relations of the sciences to each other, and the meaning of science, to help us develop a "feel" for the subject.

We know that *we do not know all the laws* as yet.

The principle of science: *The test of all knowledge is experiment*.

In philosophy, even a very small effect sometimes requires profound changes in our ideas.



What is our over-all picture of the world?

## 1-2 Matter is made of atoms

**atomic hypothesis**:

All things are made of atoms -- little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.



*Angstrom* (`Å`) ~(埃，长度单位)~ :

- we call $10^{-10}m$ an angstrom.
- so, if some atoms or $1$ or $2\times10^{-10}$ m in radius, we say they are `1Å` or `2Å` in radius.

Heat: 

- Atoms are continually jiggling and bouncing, turning and twisting around one another. These motions of atoms is what we represent as heat.
