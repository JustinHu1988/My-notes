# Chapter 18 From Abaci to Chips





#### Mid-1970s

Now, let's pause our time machine in the mid-1970s.

Several different technologies were used to fabricate the components that make up integrated circuits. Each of these technologies is sometimes called a *family* of ICs.

By the mid-1970s, two families were prevalent:

- **TTL** (transistor-transistor logic) 晶体管晶体管逻辑电路 ([tee  tee  ell])
- **CMOS** (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Transistor) 互补金属氧化物半导体 ([see moss])
