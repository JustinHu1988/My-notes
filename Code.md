# Chapter 18 From Abaci to Chips





### Mid-1970s

Now, let's pause our time machine in the mid-1970s.

Several different technologies were used to fabricate the components that make up integrated circuits. Each of these technologies is sometimes called a *family* of ICs.

By the mid-1970s, two families were prevalent:

- **TTL** (transistor-transistor logic) 晶体管晶体管逻辑电路 ([tee  tee  ell])
- **CMOS** (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Transistor) 互补金属氧化物半导体 ([see moss])


#### TTL

[*The TTL Data Book for Design Engineers*]:

This is *a complete reference* to the 7400 series of TTL integrated circuits. (*You could actually build the computer in Chapter 17 out of TTL chips*.)

For example, first IC in the 7400 series is number 7400: `Quadruple 2-Input Positive-NAND Gates`, means that this particular integrated circuit contains four 2-input NAND gate, they are called `positive` NAND gates because a voltage corresponds to 1 and no voltage corresponds to 0. This is a 14-pin chip:

- Pin 14 is labeled $V_{cc}$ and is equivalent to the V symbol to indicate a voltage.
- Pin 7 is labeled $GND$ for ground.
- Every integrated circuit that you use in a particular circuit must be connected to a power supply and a common ground.
- For 7400 series TTL, $V_{cc}$ must be between 4.75 and 5.25 volts. Even if you were to find a 5-volt battery, the voltage wouldn't be exact enough to be adequate for these chips. So, TTL usually requires a power supply that you plug into the wall.
- The output of a TTL gate is typically about 0.2V for a logical 0, and 3.4V for a logical 1. Because these voltages can vary somewhat, inputs and outputs to integrated circuits are sometimes referred to as `low` and `high` rather than 0 and 1.
- Moreover, sometimes a low voltage can mean a logical 1 and a high voltage can mean a logical 0. This configuration is referred to as `negative logic`.(7400IC is `positive logic`).



**Propagation time**: 

- the time a particular integrated circuit takes for the change in the inputs to be reflected in the output. (most important fact for an IC)
- generally measured in nanoseconds, abbreviated nsec.
  - For example, the propagation time for the NAND gates in the 7400 chip is guaranteed to be less than 22 nanoseconds.



#### CMOS

[*CMOS Databook*] : This book contains information about the 4000 series of CMOS ICs.

**TTL vs CMOS**:

- The power supply requirement for TTL is 4.75 to 5.25 volts. For CMOS, it's anything
  *from 3 volts to 18 volts*. That's quite a leeway!

- CMOS requires *much less power* than TTL, which makes it feasible to run small CMOS circuits from batteries.

- The drawback of CMOS: *lack of speed*.

- (But today, there are *low-power versions of TTL* and *high-speed versions of CMOS*.)

#### Microprocessor

By the early 1970s, it became possible to use ICs to create an entire computer processor on a single circuit board.

In November 1971, *Intel 4004*, the first "computer on a chip", or *microprocessor* became available. 4004 contained 2300 transistors.

Beside the number of its transistors, there are three other important characteristics of the 4004. These three measures are often used as **standard for comparison among microprocessors**:

1. *Wide of the data paths*
   - the 4004 was a 4-bit microprocessor.
2. *Clock speed*
   - Clock speed is the maximum speed of an oscillator that you can connect to the microprocessor to make it go.
   - the 4004 had a maximum clock speed of 108KHz.
3. *Addressable memory*
   - the addressable memory of the 4004 was 640 bytes.

These three numbers *don't affect the **capability** of a computer*, but *affect the **speed** of a computer*. The speed of a processor ultimately affects the over-all usefulness of a computer system.

And, speed is a big reason why we're using computers to begin with.

These three numbers indicate only roughly how fast the microprocessor operates. These number tell you nothing about the internal architecture of the microprocessor or about the efficiency and capability of the machine-code instructions.



4004 was a start. By April 1972, Intel had released the *8008*—an 8-bit microprocessor running at 200 kHz that could address 16 KB of memory. 

And then, in a five-month period in 1974, both Intel and Motorola came out with microprocessors that were intended to improve on the 8008. These two chips are *8080* and *6800*, and they change the world.
